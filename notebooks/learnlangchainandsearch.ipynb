      "Summary: Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (; Latin American Spanish: [ˈkaɾla kaˈmila kaˈβeʝo esˈtɾaβao]; born March 3, 1997) is an American singer and songwriter. She rose to prominence as a member of the pop girl group Fifth Harmony, which became one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. While in the group, Cabello began to establish herself as a solo artist with the release of her collaborative singles \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (with Shawn Mendes) and \"Bad Things\" (with Machine Gun Kelly)—the latter peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. She left Fifth Harmony in late 2016.\n",
      "Cabello's debut studio album, Camila (2018), peaked atop the US Billboard 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and saw generally positive critical reception. Largely influenced by Latin music, its lead single \"Havana\" (featuring Young Thug) received diamond certification by the RIAA, peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and did so in 23 other countries, including the UK and Canada. Its follow-up, \"Never Be the Same\" reached the top ten in multiple countries. Her 2019 duet with Shawn Mendes, \"Señorita\" was met with similar success as the former—becoming her second song to peak the Billboard Hot 100—and was included on her second album, Romance (2019). The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and spawned the top 20 single \"My Oh My\" (featuring DaBaby).\n",
      "Further leaning into Latin pop, Cabello released her third studio album Familia (2022) to continued success; it was preceded by the single \"Don't Go Yet\" and peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200. Its second single, \"Bam Bam\" (featuring Ed Sheeran), reached the top five of the Billboard Global 200—Cabello's highest entry on the chart—and peaked within the top ten in several countries, and number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n",
      "Cabello has amassed billions of streams on music platforms, and \"Havana\" became the best-selling digital single of 2018, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Cabello's awards include two Latin Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and one Billboard Music Award. In 2021, Cabello starred as the title character in the film Cinderella.\n",
      "In 2024, Camila Cabello released her fourth studio album, C,XOXO, a project that explores genres like hyperpop, hip-hop, and experimental pop. It features collaborations with artists such as Playboi Carti, Lil Nas X, and Drake. The album delves into themes of love, self-discovery, and empowerment, reflecting Cab\n"
